# Introduction

This tutorial aims to show how methods described in the two papers by @skene_analysis_2010_I^,^^[@skene_analysis_2010_II] can be applied with mixed models in [R](#R) or in [SAS](#SAS).

In particular we will focus on: 

  * Modified Box Correction
  * Scheffe contrast
  * *Can add more as I go*

***

## SAS {SAS-Intro}

The analysis for these two papers were carried out using SAS. 
  
## R {R-Intro}

There are multiple packages in R that allow you to fit mixed models. The most popular are the **nlme** and **lme4** package. Some of the differences between the two packages are described on page 4 of the **lme4** package documentation (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/lme4.pdf). 

The main difference is that the **nlme** package allows more flexibility in choosing complex variance-covariance structures. With the **lme4** package only allowing us to select the correlation structure between individuals via the random effects (G side).

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
